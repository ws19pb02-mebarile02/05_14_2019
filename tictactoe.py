tictactoe.py

This program accepts a tictactoe board configuration from the user and determines if
it is a winner.  It protects against incorrect input and the possibiity of both X and O
winning, but it does not protect against a configuration where either X or O have multiple
winning combinations on the same board, so that needs to be worked out.  An example:
XXX
XXX
XOX
